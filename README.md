Coding Challenge Submission for Conway's Game of Life

HTML and JS
Using a 2d Array, recreate Conway's Game of Life:

If a dead cell has exactly three live neighbors, it comes to life  - life is created

If a live cell has less than two live neighbors, it dies    - UNDERPOPULATION

If a live cell has more than three live neighbors, it dies  - OVERPOPULATION

If a live cell has two or three live neighbors, it continues living - life is PRESERVED

As an extra bonus, mirror the edges to create a wrap effect at the edges

This example will eventually stabilize, establishing life across the canvas.
